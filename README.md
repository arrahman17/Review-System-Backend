Server side code 

We have an issue to upload code to GitHub through Git and also through Bit-Bucket
The error shows " Warning : adding embedded git respository: client "
So i uploaded in two portion , one for Server side(Express and Node) and other for Application development server (in Angular).
if you have both the code , just merge them and Install NPM.

how to run Server side module of our well known App "Review - System "

Make sure you have the mongo db install on your pc , if not then go to uni due moodle , we already put the installation guide of mongo check that file from start to end , it will help you in the installation of the mongodb

After installation of the mongo db , open the command prompt and run as the administrator and type mongod , and then open the mongo.exe which is in the bin folder of the mongo db folder

if you set the path of mongo db globally than you can run mongo from the direct command prompt , no need to route in the mongo db folder 

once mongo db is open and set to run it will show in the command prompt that server is connected and ready to run

Than as mention above open mongo , and for testing write any mongo db command let say show dbs , it will show all the database which are currently exist 

than route to the project folder and open cmd and run npm start , it will start the node server and when it shows that that server is starting port : 3000 , it means all is ok and now your back end is running and triggered

thats all for the back end part , please check the read me of the front end which is in client folder to know how to run front end module of our well known app "Review - System "
