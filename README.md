Server side code 

We have an issue to upload code to GitHub through Git and also through Bit-Bucket
The error shows " Warning : adding embedded git respository: client "
So i uploaded in two portion , one for Server side(Express and Node) and other for Application development server (in Angular).
if you have both the code , just merge them and Install NPM.

Make sure you have MongoDB Installed, Run Mongod and as well as mongo
then open cmd in project folder and type " Npm start"
open another cmd in Client folder and write " ng serve"
